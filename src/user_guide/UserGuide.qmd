On the top of the assignment details page will be a visual overview of assignment completion for the class.

Below that is a table outlining each student status and report on the assignment. Each row of the table contains:

- Name
: Name of the student for this row entry.
- Completion Status
: Indication of whether a student has completed this assignment. A green check signals completion while a dash means unfinished.
- Graded Status
: Indication if this student's assignment has been graded. A green check indicates the assignment has been graded, while a dash means it is ungraded.
- Student Reports
: A link to view an individual student's performance report on this simulation such as avg heart rate or response time. `N/A` means no report for that student is available.

##### Student Performance Reports 

::: {.callout-note}

This feature is still work in progress, some reports and/or statistics may not be available.

<video autoplay loop muted playsinline style="max-width: 100%; margin-top: 1rem;">
  <source src="../assets/gifs/get_report.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

:::

The reports page allows an instructor to view detailed statistics of a student's performance over a particular simulation such as their average reaction time or number of mistakes.

To view a student's report:

1. Go to the [view details page](#viewing-details) of a particular assignment.
2. Scroll to the student you would like to view the report for.
3. Click the document icon to view the report for that student on this simulation.

The left portion of the report page highlights key parameters that were assessed during the simulation such as `heart rate`, `handling of critical vitals`, etc.

Beside each parameter is an indicator of the performance in that section with three possible colors:

- ![](../assets//performance_status/pass.svg){width=20} Green/Excellent
: The student's performance in this category was below the critical threshold of error.
- ![](../assets//performance_status/acceptable.svg){width=20}  Amber/Acceptable
: The student's performance in this category was at or slightly above the critical threshold of error.
- ![](../assets//performance_status/fail.svg){width=20} Red/Failed
: The student's performance in this category was severely above the critical threshold of error.

###### Submitting Written Feedback

In addition to viewing detailed statistics collected by the simulation on the student performance, you can also write individual feedback to each student.

::: {=html}
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline style="max-width: 100%; margin-top: 1rem;">
  <source src="../assets/gifs/edit_feedback.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

:::

To write feedback:

1. Access the report of the student you would like to write feedback for.
2. Type in the feedback you would like to provide to the student.
3. Any previously written feedback will be inside the text box. To edit existing feedback simply make the changes to the text box.
4. Click `Submit Feedback` to upload and save the feedback for the student to view.

# Simulation

## Using the Simulator

Test out using the simulation with [Vet Scientia Demo](https://vs-capstone.itch.io/vs-demo).

To focus on the animal, click the animal.

To check the animal's vitals, focus on the animal and then hover over the animal. You will see a popup of the vitals like heart rate and respiratory rate.

To exit focus on any object, click the back button located towards the bottom of the screen.

To examine the drugs, click the cabinet on the left.

To look at the name of a drug, hover over the drug.

To equip a drug, click the drug bottle.

To get a short description of the drug, click the thumbnail of the drug.

To apply a drug to the animal, equip the drug, focus on the animal, and then click the animal. The drug thumbnail should disappear.

## Running the Guided Demo

Each prompt will guide you to:

- Interact with the anesthesia machine controls  
- Read realâ€‘time values on the monitors  
- Examine the dog model and view its vitals  
- Pick up and instantly equip drugs from the cabinet  
- Navigate the room using pointâ€‘andâ€‘click

## Basic Controls

- **Look around:** Click and drag with the mouse  
- **Interact:** Leftâ€‘click on objects (cabinet doors, knobs, dog, monitors)  
- **Cancel / Back:** Press the **Back** button (or Esc)  
- **UI tooltips:** Hover over buttons and icons for explanatory text  

---

## Tutorial Flow

1. **Start:** The narrator introduces the simulation goals.  
2. **Machine:** Learn to toggle knobs and switches on the anesthesia machine.  
3. **Monitor:** Observe how vitals update in real time.  
4. **Dog:** Click the dog to bring up its current vital statistics.  
5. **Drugs:** Click a drug icon in the cabinet to equip it; notice the Equipped Drug slot updates.  
6. **Administration:** Click the dog again to apply the drug and watch vital changes on the monitor.  
7. **Navigation:** Practice pointing and clicking to move between stations in the room.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Project opens without Console errors  
- [ ] UserTest scene loads and begins narration  
- [ ] You can operate the anesthesia machine controls  
- [ ] Monitor displays changing vitals correctly  
- [ ] Dog vitals panel appears when you click the dog  
- [ ] Equipped Drug slot updates when you pick up a drug  
- [ ] Administering the drug alters the dogâ€™s vitals on the monitor  
- [ ] Pointâ€‘andâ€‘click navigation works smoothly
